2,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Bandra, Maharashtra, India",213.0,"Following a right turn, after taking off, the plane rolled to the left beyond 90 degrees, went into a steep dive, crashed and exploded in shallow water. Irrational control wheel inputs on the part of the captain after his attitude director indicator malfunctioned leading to complete loss of situational awareness."
3,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Parepare, Indonesia",102.0,"While flying at FL350 the airliner went missing between Surabaya and Manado in poor weather conditions after the pilot reported strong winds. Wreckage was found 5 miles south of Parepare. The accident was caused by the autopilot being accidentally disconnected. The two pilots had been trying to fix a problem with the plane's navigation instruments when they disconnected the autopilot and lost control of the plane. Without the autopilot, the plane went out of control, listing to the right and pitching down."
4,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Near Irrupts, Siberia, Russia",125.0,"The plane crashed during takeoff following a fire in the No. 2 engine and subsequent loss of the two remaining engines. Faulty air starter unit. Crew took off ignoring the 'starter warning light' thinking it was false.  The crew underestimated the severity of the situation due to shortcomings in the operational documentation.  Breakup of the No.2 engine starter, damaging fuel and oil lines and causing a fire."
5,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt",148.0,"Shortly after taking off,  the aircraft crashed into the Red Sea, 7 miles south of the airport. There were mostly French tourists on board heading home for the holidays. Pilot spatial disorientation."

7,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Antonov.Antonov,"Kinshasa, Zaire",227.0,"The aircraft failed to gain altitude after taking off from N'Dolo Airport and ran off the runway and crashed into a market square. The plane was overloaded by 595 lbs. The aircraft certification was revoked and crew did not have authorization to fly. The number killed on the ground varies widely from different sources. The number of fatalities, 225, is derived from the publication Weekly Mail and Guardian in an article covering the court trial of the pilots, charging them with the deaths of 225 people. Some sources quote as many as 350 died."
8,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Vickers.Vickers,"Ankara, Turkey",104.0,"Midair collision between a civilian and military aircraft. Both planes crashed into a heavily populated area destroying buildings, houses and vehicles. Fourteen killed on the Viscount, three on the C-47 and 87 on the ground. Cause attributed to a military flight training zone extending into the approach pattern associated with civilian aircraft. The Viscount aircraft had an IFR flight plan but was cruising under VFR conditions and did not see the C-47 until it was too late."
9,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Pagalungan, Philippines",104.0,"Flight 387 originated in Manila on a flight to Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro. The aircraft crashed while on approach to Cagay de Oro into a remote mountainous area.  Wreckage was found near the town of Pagalungan, NE of Cagay de Oro. The last radio message from the pilot was 'leveling off at 5,000 feet sir.'  The cockpit voice recorder revealed that the GPWS warned of terrain a dozen times just before impact. The crew apparently got lost in a cloud, never realizing they were headed into a mountain. Pilot error, inadequate training standards and deficient equipment."
10,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Peshawar, Pakistan",104.0,"Unable to land at Kabul because of a blizzard, the crew tried to reach Peshawar, Pakistan but crashed into 11,000 ft. Chaperi Mountain near Kabul."
11,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Tokyo Bay, Japan",133.0,"The jetliner crashed about 7.5 miles ESE of Tokyo International (Haneda) Airport where it was scheduled to land. The aircraft was on VFR approach and was observed at a height of 2, 000 ft. just before the crash.  Cause undetermined. Excessive sink rate is thought to have caused four 727 accidents in succession. Lake Michigan 8/16/65, Cincinnati 11/8/65, Salt Lake City 11/11/65 and Tokyo Bay 2/4/66. Only the Salt Lake and Cincinnati crashes were officially attributed to it. After 727 training manuals were modified and pilots were reoriented to the flying characteristics of the aircraft the problem was corrected."
12,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Douglas.Douglas,"San Jose Volcano, Chile",87.0,"After an improper climb, the aircraft flew into a 12,000 ft. mountain in the La Melosas area of the Andes. Crew did not follow flight plan for climbing out of Santiago."

14,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Puerto Plata, Domincan Republic",189.0,"The plane crashed into the AtlantiOcean, 21 km north of Puerto Plata, shortly after taking off. Incorrect airspeed indications resulting from a clogged pitot tube. The readings were greater than the actual airspeed resulting in the crew reducing  power and leading to a stall. Failure of the crew to recognize the activation of the control column shaker as a warning of an imminent stall. Failure of the crew to carry out the procedures to recover the aircraft from the stall and restore lift."
15,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Antonov.Antonov,Northern India,98.0,Vanished without a trace over the Himalayas while en route.
16,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Douglas.Douglas,"Off Jones Beach, New York, New York",84.0,"The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off after taking evasive action to avoid  Pan American Flight 212, a  Boeing-707, that was planning to land. The aircraft were separated vertically by approximately 1,000 feet although this was not known to the  controllers involved. The EAL captain had the illusion that a potential collision course existed. As a result of this illusion, a descent was initiated. In this circumstance the DC-7 was placed in an unusual attitude, resulting in spatial disorientation of the crew. Placement of the two aircraft on a near head on course which prompted the EAL plane to make an evasive maneuver from which the pilots could not recover."
17,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Santa Maria, Azores, Portugal",144.0,"The airliner hit a mountain while attempting to land at Santa Maria. The crew mistakenly continued to descend through 3,000 ft. which it was clear to. Because of a overlap in communications, the tower did not notice the mistake. The aircraft continued to descend and did not comment or react to warnings from the GPSW for 7 seconds. The aircraft then hit Pico Alto mountain at an altitude of 2,000 ft.  Procedural errors by the flight crew and ATC. Descent of the aircraft below minimum sector altitude. Transmission from the tower of a QNH value higher than the actual value."
18,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Near Tehran, Iran",133.0,Midair collision with an Iranian Air Force fighter while taking off. One hundred thirty-one killed on the Tupolev and one killed on the Su-24.

20,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Jamaica Bay, New York, New York",95.0,"After taking off from Idlewild Airport and reaching a height of 1,500 feet, the aircraft made a left turn but continued to roll until it was inverted and crashed into Jamaica Bay approximately 3 miles southwest of the control tower. A rudder control malfunction which caused  a full unwanted rudder deployment, yaw, sideslip and roll which led to loss of control of the aircraft. This was caused by the use of an improper tool at the manufacturing plant to wrap the rudder servo unit's wiring, damaging the wires and leading to a short circuit. There is speculation that the accident was actually caused by the captain putting the aircraft in a steep 45 degree bank which resulted in the loss of control of the aircraft."
21,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Near Zephyr Cove, Nevada",85.0,The aircraft crashed into Genoa Peak while attempting to land under VFR conditions after a missed approach and go-around. The captain's decision not to wait until the weather improved or divert to an alternate airport during adverse weather conditions. The pilot's deviation from prescribed VFR flight procedures in attempting a visual landing approach in adverse weather conditions. This resulted in an abandoned approach and geographical disorientation while flying below the minimum altitude prescribed or operations in mountainous areas. The aircraft was named City of Los Angeles.
22,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Near Ermenonville, France",346.0,"The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from Orly Airport in Paris, France. Climbing through FL110 the aircraft lost the rear cargo door, resulting in explosive decompression and damage to the cabin floor and control cables. The aircraft lost control and crashed in a forest at a high rate of speed. The service subcontractor and the flight engineer neglected to check the locking mechanism through a recently installed viewport to verify the door was latched properly. In addition, although a service bulletin stipulated that the locking pin should be extended, it was mistakenly shortened causing the latch to release after the cabin was pressurized. On June 12, 1972, an American Airlines DC-10 lost its cargo door shortly after taking off from Detroit Michigan. Using mainly engine thrust the crew was able to land safely. The cause was a defect in the latching mechanism on the door."
23,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Douglas.Douglas,"Douala, Cameroon",111.0,The aircraft had a unusually long take-off run and appeared to gain altitude with difficulty. One and one-half miles from the runway the aircraft struck trees and crashed into a tidal swamp and burst into flames.  A jammed right elevator spring tab caused the crew to lose of control of the aircraft.
24,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Gotemba City, Mt. Fuji, Japan",124.0,The aircraft crashed into Mt. Fuji after encountering severe turbulence when the pilot decided to give the passengers a view of the mountain. The aircraft encountered severe clear air turbulence and started to come apart in the air before crashing.
25,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Fokker.Fokker,"Skopje, Macedonia",83.0,"The aircraft shuttered violently after takeoff,  rolled to the left, then right and crashed. Icing. Loss of roll controllability due to contamination on the wings with ice. Failure to de-ice the plane before taking off."
26,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Ilyushin.Ilyushin,"Near Voronezh, Russia",127.0,"The aircraft plunged to earth from FL 260. Electrical power failure of compass, gyros and auto pilot."
27,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Tamanrasset, Algeria",102.0,"The starboard engine caught fire and failed while the plane was attempting to take off. The aircraft continued about 2,000 ft. past the end of the runway and crashed. The accident was caused by the loss of an engine during a critical phase of flight, the non-retraction of the landing gear after the engine failure, and the Captain, the pilot not flying, taking over control of the airplane before having clearly identified the problem."
28,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Saigon, Vietnam",155.0,"The aircraft reported it was returning to Tan Son Nhut Airbase 15 minutes after taking off. The aircraft was not able to make the airport and crashed landed into a rice paddy, 1.5 miles from the airport. The flight was evacuating 243 Vietnamese orphans. Pressure failure due to a faulty rear loading ramp caused decompression which led to severed rudder and elevator cables and loss of two hydraulisystems resulting in a loss of pitch control. Worst single non-combat U.S. military aviation disaster."
29,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Vickers.Vickers,"Near Hochwald, Solothurn,  Switzerland",108.0,Cashed into a forest during a snowstorm. Malfunctioning navigation equipment. Navigational error by crew.
30,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Near Dawson, Texas",85.0,"On a flight from Houston to Dallas the airliner flew into thunderstorms. While attempting to turn around by making a right hand turn, winds lifted the port wing, forcing the starboard wing down past 90 degrees.  A stall resulted from this unusual attitude, pitching the nose down. During the recovery maneuver, the starboard wing was over-stressed, separating from the aircraft followed by the the tail and engines. The aircraft crashed into a field. Pilot's decision to penetrate a line of thunderstorms and severe weather. Visual perception of the pilot may have been reduced by a near lightning strike."
31,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Off Sochi, Russia",113.0,The jetliner crashed into the Black Sea and broke up in driving rain and low visibility after making a second attempt to land. The plane disappeared from radar screens just under four miles from shore and crashed after making a turn and heading toward Adler airport for a landing. Pilot error. The pilots of the Airbus-320  allowed the plane to descend too low as it faced bad weather on its approach to the airport.
32,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.BAC.BAC,"Kano, Nigeria",149.0,"The aircraft crashed into houses, two mosques and a school in the densely populated neighborhood of Gwammaja, approximately  1.2 miles from Kano International Airport, shortly after taking off. There were reports of an engine failure and  fire during the takeoff."
33,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Near Carini, Sicily, Italy",115.0,The plane cashed into Mt. Lunga during an approach to Palermo. The crew's non-adherence to airport traffiregulations. The aircraft was named Antonio Pigafetta.

35,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Off Dalian, China",112.0,"The MD-82 crashed into the Dalian Bay, 12 miles east of Dalian airport. The pilot reported a fire aboard the aircraft and the cabin lights were out prior to the plane impacting the water.  The accident was caused by an act of sabotage by a passenger who lit a fire in the cabin. He had bought multiple insurance policies before boarding the flight."
36,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Ilyushin.Ilyushin,"Near Kinshasa, Congo",129.0,"A large number of military personnel and their family members were sucked out of the plane after the aircraft's back ramp accidentally dropped open in flight. The ramp opened as the pressure system broke down. The crew managed to control the plane and turn it around and land at Kinshasa airport following the accident, which took place 45 minutes into the flight. There is a wide discrepancy in the number killed ranging from 0 to 250."
37,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Ilyushin.Ilyushin,"Warsaw, Poland",183.0,"The No. 2 engine failed, causing an engine fire, cabin decompression, damage to the  No. 1 engine, loss of  elevator control and damage to the electrical system. A fire in the cargo hold was not detected because of damage to the fire warning system. While attempting to return to Warsaw and attempting a turn to land, the aircraft crashed into a forest, 9 miles short of the runway. The cause of the engine failure was an overheated bearing. The aircraft was named Tadeusz Kosciuszko."
38,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Everglades, Miami, Florida",110.0,"The aircraft crashed 18 miles NW of Miami airport  in a remote part of the Everglades. Shortly after taking off, after the crew reported fire and smoke in the cabin and cockpit. The in-flight fire was caused by activation of one or more oxygen generators in the forward cargo hold. The generators were outdated, improperly labeled, lacked safety caps and were prohibited from being transported on a passenger flight. The loss of control resulted either from flight control failure or incapacitation of the crew due to extreme heat and smoke.  Candi Kubeck was the first American female commercial airline captain to be killed in a crash. San Diego Chargers running back Rodney Culver, 26, and his wife were among the passengers killed as was singer, songwriter Walter Hyatt, 46."
39,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Kham Duc, Vietnam",155.0,"Shot down by enemy fire while attempting to evacuate Kham Ducivilians.  The aircraft shook  violently, crashed and burst into flames in a ravine at the end of the airstrip."
40,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Villeneuve-le-Roi, Val-de-Marne, France",130.0,"During takeoff from Orly Airport, the nose rose for about 5 seconds and then dropped back down on the runway. Smoke streamed from the wheels as the crew tried to stop the aircraft but it ran off the runway and collided with the runway lights and a house. The only survivors were two stewardesses who were seated in the tail section which broke free in the crash. The aircraft's horizontal stabilizer was improperly trimmed due to a failure of the trim servo motor."
41,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Douglas.Douglas,"PacifiOcean, 116 miles WSW of Annette Island, Alaska",101.0,"The aircraft was being flown under contract to the military. While en route, the aircraft crashed into the sea.  The last known message was a request to ascend from 14,000 ft. to 18,000 ft. The last known position was 54 degrees 14 minutes N, 134 degrees 41 minutes W. Unable to determine the probable cause due to lack of evidence."
42,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Douglas.Douglas,"Mt. Canigou, near Roussillon, France",88.0,Crashed into a mountain while attempting to land. Series of errors by the crew due to intoxication by carbon monoxide fumes. Difficulty in communication between the ATC and crew due to lack of phraseology.
43,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Near Xi'an, China",160.0,The plane broke-up in flight 10 minutes after taking off. Auto-pilot induced oscillations caused the aircraft to shake violently. The autopilot yaw-channel was accidentally connected to the bank control and the bank-channel to the yaw controls.
44,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Near Paramaribo, Surinam",176.0,The aircraft hit a tree and crashed during a third landing attempt in fog. The crew descended below the published minimum altitude. Despite concerns about possible landing equipment failures the crew was determined to make a landing and not divert to another airport as they were running out of fuel. They could not get an ILS signal and ignored a Ground Proximity Warning System alarm 60 seconds prior to the crash by turning it off 10 seconds after it started its warning. About 20 members from the Dutch soccer team 'Colorful 11' from Surinam were killed.
45,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Pacatuba, Brazil",137.0,"The aircraft crashed into a 2,500 ft. mountain (Serra da Aratanha) during an approach in heavy rain and fog. Despite two altitude alert system warnings and the co-pilot's warning of the mountains ahead, the captain continued to descend below the minimum descend altitude. Non-observance of air traffiand carrier's procedures."
46,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.de Havilland.de Havilland,"Near Arbucias, Gerona, Spain",112.0,"Due to heavy traffic, the flight was diverted from the planned route. The aircraft failed to follow the assigned airway and crashed into a cloud obscured Montseny Mountain while on approach. The deviation from the assigned airway may have been caused by malfunctioning equipment. In addition, the ATC did not realize the aircraft was deviating from its assigned course."
47,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Over the Persian Gulf, near Bandar Abbas, Iran",290.0,"The civilian Iranian airliner was shot down by the U.S. Navy vessel U.S.S. Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner."
48,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Near Irkutsk, Russia",145.0,"The plane crashed and exploded in flames in Siberian woodlands near the village of Burdakovka, about 21 miles from Irkutsk. The aircraft crashed during the third turn in a landing approach to Irkutsk, an intermediate stop for refueling. The first officer was flying the plane, when at 2,600 ft., an audible alarm sounded indicating a wide angle of attack. Eleven seconds later the aircraft swung around 180 degrees and entered a flat spin. The captain ordered the engines at full throttle but it was too late and 22 seconds later the plane hit the ground, belly first, broke up and burned.Â Incorrect actions of the crew. Due to poor communication between pilots, they put in the wrong parameters while landing causing the plane to descend at the wrong angle. As a result, the plane stalled and entered a spin and crashed."
49,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Toronto, Canada",109.0,"While attempting to land at Toronto, at approximately 60 feet above the runway, the spoilers were inadvertently deployed causing the aircraft to fall to the runway and lose the No. 4 engine. With the wing on fire, the captain decided to go-around but while circling the plane lost the No. 3 engine and eventually went into a seep dive and crashed. Inadvertent deployment of the spoilers by the first officer while the aircraft was still in the air. Faulty design by allowing the spoiler handle to perform two different unrelated tasks (lift to arm and pull to deploy). After the crash McDonnell Douglas denied there was any design flaw and the FAA decided to issue an Airworthiness Directive requiring a warning placard on all DC8s. After two and possibly three more crashed with the same cause an AD was issued requiring a safety lock be installed."
50,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Ilyushin.Ilyushin,"Near Moscow, Russia",90.0,The aircraft crashed and burned in field shortly after takeoff. Failure of the aircraft's power plant fire warning system due to design deficiencies which resulted in false fire indications in both engines.
51,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Near Junnar, Maharashtra, India",94.0,"The aircraft crashed into a hill near Bombay, India, at an elevation of 3,600 ft. 50 miles ENE of the airport. Navigational error.  Premature descent. Crew did not use navigational facilities available."
52,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Nar Alma-Ata, Kasakastan, USSR",166.0,The aircraft crashed and burned in a field 2 minutes after takeoff. Windshear.
53,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Port Sudan, Sudan",116.0,"The plane's crew reported technical difficulties (engine failure) 10 minutes after taking off from Port Sudan Airport. The plane crashed into a hillside, 3 miles from the airport as the crew tried to return and make emergency landing. A three-year-old boy was the only survivor."
54,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Kenner, Louisiana",153.0,"The aircraft crashed during a thunderstorm, 29 seconds after taking off from New Orleans International Airport. The plane reached an altitude of 95 to 150 feet and then began to descend and crashed into trees and houses bursting into flames. Microbust induced windshear. Limited capability of current ground-based low-level windshear detection technology. The aircraft was named 'Clipper Defiance.'"
55,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Irkutsk, Russia",128.0,"The plane was landing at Irkutsk International Airport in rain and low visibility when it veered off and overran the runway, struck a building and burst into flames. It was reported the plane was traveling at a high rate of speed when it landed. Crew error. The mistaken and uncontrolled actions by the crew at the stage of slowing down after landing. The unintentional and uncontrolled movement in one of the engines, which was not detected by the crew in time."
56,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Near Uchuduk, Uzbekistan, USSR",200.0,The aircraft went into an uncontrolled descent from FL 400 and crashed.
57,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Paris, Orly, France",123.0,Fire aboard the aircraft in the aft right toilet was reported and an emergency descent made. The plane was heavily damaged by fire before fire fighters could rescue passengers. Most fatalities were due to CO before rescuers could reach passengers. The fire started in the aft right toilet either from an electrical short or discarded cigarette.
58,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Cuenca, Azuay, Ecuador",119.0,"The jetliner scraped a mountian peak, exploded in flames and slid down a ravine coming to rest at the foot of a mountain. The plane was attempting to land in the Andean city of Cuenca. Under-qualification of pilot."
59,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",261.0,"After taking off, fire was reported in the landing gear well. The aircraft crashed while trying to return to the airport. Loss of hydraulics and electrical systems after a fire, started in the wheel when two tires disintegrated due to under inflation of one tire. This caused a fire which ignited years of accumulated flammables in the DC-8's wheel well leading to an uncontroable fire. The plane was allowed to leave with an under inflated tire. Twenty minutes prior to departure, the Nationair lead mechanimade a request for nitrogen to inflate the low tire. Nitrogen was not readily available and a delay would probably have occur procuring it. The Nationair project manager, without conferring with the flight crew, released the plane."
60,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Ft. Worth-Dallas, Texas",135.0,"While on a flight from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Dallas/ Forth Worth, the aircraft crashed while making an landing attempt in thunderstorm activity. The plane touched down 6,000 feet short of the runway and 360 feet to the left of the runway centerline, became airborne again, struck a car killing the driver, crossed the highway and crashed into two water tank reservoirs. Microburst induced windshear. The flightcrew's decision to initiate and continue the approach into a cumulonimbus cloud which they observed to contain lightning. Lack of training for avoiding and escaping from low-altitude windshear."
61,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Immouzer, Morocco",188.0,"The aircraft was on approach when the right wing tip and No. 4 engine struck a mountain peak at 2,400 feet.  Part of the wing separated and the plane crashed into a ravine. Crew error."

Won Guam International Airport. The runway glide slope system was inoperative. In addition, the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning system (MSAW) was also not working due to a software problem. The captainâ??s failure to adequately brief and execute the non-precision approach and the first officer's and flight engineer's failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captainâ??s execution of the approach. Contributing to these failures were the captain's fatigue and Korean Air's  inadequate flight crew training. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) intentional inhibition of the MSAW at Guam and the agency's failure to adequately manage the system."
63,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Irkutsk, USSR",100.0,A few seconds after taking off the airliner lost altitude and slammed into the tarmaexploding in flames.
64,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Near Cuzco, Peru",101.0,"The flight crashed shortly after takeoff after the No. 3 engine failed. Procedural error after an emergency occurred.

The controller lacked the radar with which to monitor the flight. Blame was placed on both the crew of the airliner and the ATC. Lack of radar facilities. Premature descent. Inexperience with the area and poor flight planning."
72,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Off Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada",229.0,"The aircraft was on a flight from JFK Airport, New York to Geneva, Switzerland when the crew reported smoke in the cockpit and requested an emergency landing at Halifax. The plane began dumping fuel and preparing for an emergency landing when it disappeared from radar and crashed into the AtlantiOcean southwest of Halifax. A fire in the entertainment system wiring started in a hidden area above the cockpit ceiling when arcing ignited the cover material made of thermal insulation blankets. This set off an in-flight fire that spread and increased in intensity until it led to the loss of the aircraft.. It was determined that  aircraft certification standards for material flammability at the time of the accident were inadequate. Dr. Jonathan Mann, researcher in the fight against AIDS killed in the crash."
73,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Ilyushin.Ilyushin,"Near Havana, Cuba",171.0,The aircraft crashed into navigational towers and residential houses shortly after takeoff in heavy rain and high winds. Decision to fly after an abrupt deterioration in weather conditions.
74,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Juneau, Alaska",111.0,The aircraft crashed into the slopes of Chikat Mountain in rain and fog while attempting a non-precision instrument landing at Juneau Municipal Airport.

Detonation of an explosive device in the aft cargo hold. A Palestinian organization claimed responsibility. The blast probably buckled the cabin floor damaging the elevator and rudder controls."
77,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Aliquippa, Pennsylvania",132.0,"While on approach, the aircraft went into a sudden nose dive from 6,000 ft. and crashed into a wooded ravine 6 miles northwest of Pittsburgh International Airport. The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence."

The MD-87 then swerved off the runway and  collided with the airport's baggage handling building, bursting into flames. The Cessna,  which was about to take off for Paris, entered the active runway by mistake, after  having been told by the tower to enter a different runway. One hundred four passengers and 6 crew on the MD-87 and  2 passengers and 2 crew on the Citation were killed along with 4 on the ground. The MD-87 was named Lage Viking.  Caused largely by human error and poorly followed safety procedures. Communication between the aircraft and the tower had been 'in English and Italian,' as opposed to aviation standards that only English be spoken. In addition, despite the poor visibility, control tower operators failed to ask the Cessna to read back his instructions to make sure they were understood."
92,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Near Omsk, Russia",178.0,"While landing, the crew noticed something on the runway, took evasive action and crashed into two cleaning vehicles.

96,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Charkhidadri, India",349.0,"Midair collision 17 km W of New Delhi.  The Saudi 747 had just taken off from New Delhi airport ascending to 14,000 feet while the Il-76 was descending. Three hundred twelve aboard the B-747 and thirty-seven aboard the Il-76 were killed. The Il-76 descended below its assigned altitude. The death toll was reduced from 351 to 349 after Kazastan Airlines reported 37 aboard rather than 39. Neither aircraft was equipped with an Airborne Collision Avoidance System. The 747 had taken off from Delhi and had been cleared to climb to FL140.  Meanwhile, the IL76, which was inbound to Delhi on the same airway, had been cleared to descend to FL150. However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew's decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight."
97,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Belle Harbor, Queens, New York",265.0,"Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn, at 2,800 ft., parts of the plane, including the vertical stabilizer and rudder, fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistiand exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed."
98,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Berryville, Virginia",92.0,The plane crashed into high terrain at approximately 270 mph during an approach to Dulles Airport. The crew's decision to descend before aircraft reached the approach segment. The crew ignored high terrain marked on the en route chart and continued their descent. Lack of clarity in ATC procedures. The issuance of the approach clearance when the flight was 44 miles from the airport on an unpublished route without clearly defined minimum altitudes. Inadequate depiction of altitude restrictions on the profile view of the approach chart for the VOR/DME approach to Runway 12 at Dulles International Airport.

126,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Grammatikos, Greece",121.0,"While flying at FL340 towards Athens the crew reported problems with their air conditioning system. As the airliner entered Greek airspace ATC lost contact with the plane. Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn't get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromos, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control was left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing."
127,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Perm, Russia",88.0,"The aircraft crashed into a ravine adjacent to railroad tracks and near an apartment building as it was approaching Perm for a landing.

137,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Near La Cucharita, Venezuela",160.0,"While en route, the crew reported engine trouble with both engines and planed to divert to Caracas. The plane began losing altitude and eventually crashed in the Sierra de Perija mountains on the Columbian-Venezuelan border. The autopilot might have reduced engine power too much after a rapid climb to FL330, allowing airspeed to bleed off to the point of a stall. Also the data recorder showed that rather than push the nose over to recover from the stall, the pilots held the yoke to their chests all the way to the ground."
138,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Phuket, Thailand",90.0,"While landing in heavy rain and strong cross winds, the aircraft skidded off the runway, struck an earth embankment and caught fire.

The Connie immediately crashed to the ground at Miller Army Air Field on Staten Island. One passenger was sucked out into one of the DC8s jet engines. Other passengers fell from the Connie as the spinning fuselage fell onto Staten Island. The United jet tried to make an emergency landing at La Guardia Airport but could not maintain altitude and crashed into the streets of Brooklyn. Forty-four passengers on the Constellation and eight-four passengers on the DC-8 were killed. Three passengers from the DC-8 died shortly after. One young boy, Stephen Baltz survived several days before succumbing to his injuries. Six people were also killed on the ground. The United crew entered a low-altitude holding pattern at 500 miles per hour, twice the speed it should have been going and flew past the clearance limits and airspace allocated to the flight. One of 2 VORs on the DC-8 was not functioning. Although the crew knew this, they failed to report this to the ATC, who probably would have provided extra radar assistance."
142,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates",85.0,The aircraft crashed and burned while making an attempt to land.

145,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off East Moriches, New York",230.0,"While on a flight from New York to Paris, France, the aircraft exploded at  FL 130, broke up and crashed into the AtlantiOcean off Long Island, N.Y. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the center wing tank that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.  To say that numerous government agencies acted strangely and suspiciously would be an understatement.  A great deal of evidence was either suppressed or ignored. Rumors persist that the plane was brought down by a missile, either by the Navy conducting exercises in the area or by terrorists."

166,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Palembang, Indonesia",104.0,"The plane disappeared off radar screens and shortly after, crashed into the Musi River. The plane, almost brand-new, cruising in good weather and with an experienced crew, suddenly left normal flight from 35,000 feet and crashed at a high rate of speed into the Sumatran jungle. The right wing and parts of the rudder separated from the aircraft before it crashed. The Indonesian National Transportation Committee found that there was insufficient evidence to find a cause for the accident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board strongly disagreed and stated the jet's cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected and its flight controls placed in a nose-down position most likely by the captain. While the U.S. NTSB stopped short of using the term suicide, its dissenting report made it clear it believed the crash was the result of actions by the captain. In July 2004 a California jury found the manufacturer of the PCU valve that controls rudder responsible for the accident after the valve was located and showed defects which may have led to a rudder hardover."
167,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Mt. Saint-Odile, near Strasbourg, France",87.0,"The aircraft hit a mountain while on approach to Strasbourg.

While performing the missed approach the plane suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 1,000 feet and crashed into the shallow waters of the gulf approximately 1 mile from the airport. The accident was a result of a fatal combination of factors, including the captain's failure to comply with standard operating procedures and the copilot's actions in not drawing the captain's attention to the deviations of the aircraft from the standard flight parameters. The captain may have suffered a 'spatial disorientation' to ground warning systems, which could have made him falsely perceive the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose down input, resulting in the aircraft starting to descend, when aircraft warning systems were saying he should increase altitude."
197,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Mina Jebel Ali, UAE",112.0,Crashed  into the desert after a distress message and during an emergency landing attempt. Detonation of an explosive device in the baggage compartment.
198,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Moroni, Comoros",127.0,"The aircraft was hijacked shortly after taking off from Ethiopia by three drunken escaped prisoners. They demanded to be flown to Australia, but wouldn't let the pilot stop to refuel. The plane eventually ran out of fuel and ditched 500 feet offshore of Le Galawa Beach on the island of Grand Comoros. When it was aparent the plane was out of fuel, the hijackers fought the pilot for control of the aircraft. In the last seconds aloft, the left wing tip struck the water and the plane crashed into the sea flipping at least once before breaking into several  parts. The water was shallow but many passengers had inflated their safety vests which prevented them from swimming out from under the cabin and they drowned."
199,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Near Cinisi, Sicily, Italy",108.0,The aircraft crashed into ocean during a landing approach. Poor monitoring of altitudes and too early a transition from ILS to visual flight procedures.

The aircraft was named Kanchenjunga."
202,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"JFK Airport, New York, New York",113.0,"The aircraft crashed into the approach lights to runway 22L at JFK while on an ILS approach to the runway. Aircraft's encounter with heavy rain and a very strong thunderstorm that was located astride the ILS localizer course which resulted in a high descent rate into approach light towers.The flightcrew's delayed recognition and correction of the high descent rate and their reliance upon visual cues rather than on flight instrument reference. However, the adverse winds might have been too severe for a successful approach and landing even had they relied upon and responded rapidly to the indications of the flight instruments.Contributing to the accident was the continued use of Runway 22L when it should have become evident to both air trafficontrol personnel and the flightcrew that a severe weather hazard existed along the approach path."
203,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Ilyushin.Ilyushin,"Near Bratislava, Czechoslovakia",82.0,"Following takeoff, the aircraft did not follow assigned route and crashed into wooded hillside. Insufficient evaluation of the weather conditions and relief of the terrain by the crew."

206,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Near Puerto Inca, Huanuco, Peru",91.0,"The aircraft was struck by lightning after it entered an area of thunderstorms and heavy turbulence. The lightning caused a fire which led to the separation of the right wing and part of the left wing. The aircraft crashed in mountainous terrain in the jungle. One German passenger, a female teenager, survived and was found after trekking through the jungle for 9 days. Juliane Koepcke had a broken collarbone and was unconscious for an unknown amount of time but had survived the crash still strapped in her seat. When she came to, she set out in vain to find her mother. Maria Koepcke, her mother, a leading Peruvian ornithologist, was dead. Rescue crews searched for the aircraft without success. Koepcke would have to save herself.  Koepcke found a stream and began nine days of wading through knee-high water and fighting off swarms of insects and leeches. On the ninth day, she found a canoe and shelter. Then she waited. Hours later, local lumbermen returned and found her. They tried to get her to eat but she was quite sick and refused. Insects had buried eggs in her skin and they were beginning to hatch. One of the men poured gasoline on her and, as she told the London Daily Mail, 'I counted 35 worms that came out of my arms alone.' The men offered what assistance they could provide but it was too late in the day to start the journey back to civilization; she slept one more night in the jungle before the men took her on the final seven hour journey via canoe down the river to a lumber station where she was airlifted to a hospital."
207,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Tenerife, Canary Islands",146.0,"The plane crashed into a mountain 5,500 ft. high at 300 mph during an approach to Tenerife.

208,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Chicago O'Hare, Illinois",273.0,"During takeoff just, as the plane lifted from the runway, the left engine and pylon separated from the aircraft damaging the wing and hydraulisystem which caused the aircraft to roll and crash. Highest single plane death toll in U.S. aviation history. Asymmetrical stall and the ensuing roll of the aircraft because of the uncommanded retraction of the left wing outboard leading edge slats and the loss of stall warning and slat disagreement indication systems caused by separation of the engine and pylon. Improper maintenance procedures used by American Airlines when dismounting the engines for maintenance, by removing the pylon and engine together, putting strain on the engine mounts leading to  stress cracks."
209,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Penghu Island, Taiwan",225.0,"The flight crashed into the sea, 31 miles NE of the Penghu (Pescadore) Islands in the Taiwan Strait. The plane disappeared from radar while flying at 35,000 ft. approximately 20 minutes after taking off from Chiang Kai Shek Airport. There was no distress call and the weather was good at the time. Military radar revealed the aircraft  disintegrated in midair, breaking into four pieces. Only 175 of 225 bodies were recovered. The carrier  failed to conduct a preventive anti-rust operation in a timely manner every four years. Damage from a 1980 tailstrike was not properly repaired and fatigue cracks formed, which eventually led to a structural failure."

212,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Aerospatiale.Aerospatiale,"Gonesse, France",113.0,"The aircraft struggled to gain altitude after taking off from Charles de Gaulle airport. The pilot reported the No. 2 engine failed and struggled to steer towards Le Bourget airfield as smoke and fire trailed the jet's left wing.   The plane was unable to gain altitude, went nose high, stalled and crashed into a small hotel complex.  A metal strip left on the runway by another plane gashed one of the Concorde's tires which blew out sending a piece of rubber into the underside of the wing which sent a shockwave which ruptured a seam in the fuel tank. An electrical severed by another piece of rubber sparked which ignited leaking fuel ignited and started an uncontrollable fire. Power was lost to the No. 1 and No. 2 engines which led to loss of control of the aircraft and subsequent crash. Investigation revealed the metal strip was probably a thrust reverser part from Continental Airlines DC-10-30 , registered N13067 which departed Paris as Flight 055 to Newark. This is the first crash of a Concorde in aviation history."
213,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"San Diego, California",144.0,"Midair collision. The PSA was descending and about to land at Lindbergh Field. The Cessna was climbing while engaged in practice approaches. The 727 overtook and struck the Cessna from the rear. The primary cause was the PSA crew lost sight of the Cessna and did not make that fact known to the ATC.  The ATC failed to realize from the PSA transmissions that they lost sight of the Cessna. One hundred thirty-five killed on the PSA, two on the Cessna and seven on the ground. Crew fatigue may have played a part in the accident as there are unofficial reports that the crew attended an all night party and had only 2 hours sleep from the night before."

251,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Off Abidjan, Ivory Coast",169.0,"The aircraft crashed into the AtlantiOcean three minutes after taking off from Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.  A few seconds after lifting off the ground the stall warning sounded and continued for about 20 seconds until it was manually turned off by the crew. Three seconds later the plane impacted the water. The pilot's response to an alarm that inaccurately indicated the plane had stalled. The pilot failed to complete established procedure for such an emergency. Takeoff conditions also contributed to the accident, which occurred at night, hampering the crew's ability to judge the plane's distance from the sea."
252,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Douglas.Douglas,"Grand Canyon, Arizona",128.0,"The TWA aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Kansas City and the United Aircraft flying from Los Angeles to Chicago collided over the Grand Canyon. Both planes were traveling about 320 mph. Both aircraft were flying in uncontrolled airspace. All  fifty-eight on the DC-7 and seventy on the Constellation killed. The pilots did not see each other in time to avoid the collision. It is not possible to determine why the pilots did not see each other, but the evidence suggests that it resulted from any one or a combination of the following factors: 1) Intervening clouds reducing time for visual separation 2) Visual limitations due to cockpit visibility 3) Preoccupation with normal cockpit duties."
253,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Near Krasnoyarsk, USSR",84.0,The aircraft went into an uncontrollable dive from FL 290.

257,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Off Point Mugu, California",88.0,"The aircraft crashed into the PacifiOcean south of Point Mugu in 650 ft. feet of water while en route from Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco. Radio transmissions from the plane indicated the pilots were struggling with a jammed stabilizer for the last 11 minutes of the flight before nose-diving into the sea. While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophieffects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti, radio financial talk show host, Dean Forshee, guitarist, Jean Gandesberry, columnist, Tom Stockley, columnist were among those killed."
258,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Maravatio, Mexico",167.0,"While climbing through 29,000 feet, an overheated tire exploded in the wheel well after takeoff and damaged the hydrauliand electrical systems of the aircraft. The plane lost control and crashed. The tire had been serviced with air rather than nitrogen. The air, under high temperature and pressure, resulted in a chemical reaction within the tire itself which led to a explosion of the tire."
259,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Logan Airport, Boston, Massachusett",89.0,The flight crashed into a seawall during ILS approach in adverse weather conditions. The failure of the flightcrew to monitor altitude and to recognize passage of the aircraft through the approach decision height during an unstabilized precision approach conducted in rapidly changing meteorological conditions. Poor positioning of the aircraft for an approach by ATC. Questionable information presented by the flight director.
260,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Near Kathmandu, Nepal",113.0,"After experiencing difficulty in deploying the flaps while approaching Katmandu, the landing was aborted.  The ATC did not have radar service. After some confusing exchanges between the tower and the aircraft, the crew headed north instead of south to begin its second approach. The aircraft flew into a near vertical mountain wall at 240 knots. In the final seconds, the captain assessed the Ground Proximity Warning System warning as false. The accident was caused by a combination of occurrences, errors and actions by both the crew and ATC. The initial problem with the flaps, the lack of radar service, a misread chart by the crew, communication difficulties and the use of non-standard phraseology among other items led to the accident."
261,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Yakovlev.Yakovlev,"Nanjing, Jiangsu, China",108.0,"The aircraft failed to gain altitude after lift-off, touched down again and overran the runway bursting into flames 2,000 feet past the runway. Possible engine failure."

The DC-9 crashed into a neighborhood destroying eleven homes and damaging seven others. Sixty-four on the DC-9, three on the Cessna and 15 on the ground were killed. The pilot of the Piper inadvertently entered the LAX Terminal Control Area. The inadvertent and unauthorized entry of the PA-28 into the Los Angeles Terminal Control Area. The limitations of the 'see and avoid' concept to ensure traffiseparation under the conditions of the conflict."
264,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Ko Phuket, Thiland",83.0,The aircraft stalled and crashed into the ocean after the crew's attention was diverted to concern over another aircraft. Failure of the crew to monitor their airspeed. The pilot added power and raised the gear after the stick shaker activated but did not execute a recovery before hitting the sea.
265,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Fokker.Fokker,"Sao Paolo, Brazil",98.0,The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff into a residential area striking a building. Uncommanded deployment of the thrust reverser on the right engine.
266,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts",217.0,"The plane took off from JFK at 1:19 a.m. bound for Cairo, Egypt. Thirty-three minutes later, after attaining an altitude of 33,000 feet, it was observed on radar in an extremely rapid descent. The aircraft was observed in a 66 degree dive at 483 knots. The descent continued to 16,700 feet after which the aircraft climbed to 24,000 ft.   After that, the plane began a second dive and broke up at around 10,000 ft. crashing into the AtlantiOcean, 60 miles southeast of Nantucket Island.  The aircraft was named Thutmosis III. The accident was caused by the relief first officer's flight control inputs which caused the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the AtlantiOcean. The reason for the first officer's actions were not determined by the NTSB. One could conclude the actions were deliberate in an attempt to commit suicide."
267,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Taipei, Taiwan",83.0,"Weather conditions at the time were extremely poor due to typhoon Xiang Sane. A NOTAM issued on Aug 31, 2000 indicated that Runway 05R was closed due to construction between Sep 13 and Nov 22. After reaching the end of Taxiway NP, the plane turned onto Taxiway N1 and then made a 180-degree turn onto Runway 05R and began its takeoff roll. Approximately 3.5 seconds after reaching V1, the aircraft hit construction equipment on the runway, crashed back to the ground, broke up and burst into flames. The pilot attempted to take off from a closed runway. The following factors contributed to the accident. Of three lights used to guide the aircraft onto the correct runway, one was not working and another dim. The airport lacked 'guard lights' used to help pilots navigate from the taxiway to the correct runway during times of poor visibility. International regulations require that a large white X be placed on the tarmaat the entrance to a closed runway, but there was none at the entrance of runway 5R. Whether there should have been, in this case, however, is itself a contentious matter as the runway remained open for taxiing."
