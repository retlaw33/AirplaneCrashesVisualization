The aircraft were separated vertically by approximately 1,000 feet although this was not known to the  controllers involved. The EAL captain had the illusion that a potential collision course existed. As a result of this illusion, a descent was initiated. In this circumstance the DC-7 was placed in an unusual attitude, resulting in spatial disorientation of the crew. Placement of the two aircraft on a near head on course which prompted the EAL plane to make an evasive maneuver from which the pilots could not recover."
29,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Santa Maria, Azores, Portugal",144.0,"The airliner hit a mountain while attempting to land at Santa Maria. The crew mistakenly continued to descend through 3,000 ft. which it was clear to. Because of a overlap in communications, the tower did not notice the mistake.

33,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Jamaica Bay, New York, New York",95.0,"After taking off from Idlewild Airport and reaching a height of 1,500 feet, the aircraft made a left turn but continued to roll until it was inverted and crashed into Jamaica Bay approximately 3 miles southwest of the control tower. A rudder control malfunction which caused  a full unwanted rudder deployment, yaw, sideslip and roll which led to loss of control of the aircraft. This was caused by the use of an improper tool at the manufacturing plant to wrap the rudder servo unit's wiring, damaging the wires and leading to a short circuit. There is speculation that the accident was actually caused by the captain putting the aircraft in a steep 45 degree bank which resulted in the loss of control of the aircraft."
34,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Near Zephyr Cove, Nevada",85.0,The aircraft crashed into Genoa Peak while attempting to land under VFR conditions after a missed approach and go-around. The captain's decision not to wait until the weather improved or divert to an alternate airport during adverse weather conditions. The pilot's deviation from prescribed VFR flight procedures in attempting a visual landing approach in adverse weather conditions. This resulted in an abandoned approach and geographical disorientation while flying below the minimum altitude prescribed or operations in mountainous areas. The aircraft was named City of Los Angeles.
35,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Near Ermenonville, France",346.0,"The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from Orly Airport in Paris, France. Climbing through FL110 the aircraft lost the rear cargo door, resulting in explosive decompression and damage to the cabin floor and control cables. The aircraft lost control and crashed in a forest at a high rate of speed. The service subcontractor and the flight engineer neglected to check the locking mechanism through a recently installed viewport to verify the door was latched properly. In addition, although a service bulletin stipulated that the locking pin should be extended, it was mistakenly shortened causing the latch to release after the cabin was pressurized. On June 12, 1972, an American Airlines DC-10 lost its cargo door shortly after taking off from Detroit Michigan. Using mainly engine thrust the crew was able to land safely. The cause was a defect in the latching mechanism on the door."
36,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Douglas.Douglas,"Douala, Cameroon",111.0,The aircraft had a unusually long take-off run and appeared to gain altitude with difficulty. One and one-half miles from the runway the aircraft struck trees and crashed into a tidal swamp and burst into flames.

The aircraft continued about 2,000 ft. past the end of the runway and crashed. The accident was caused by the loss of an engine during a critical phase of flight, the non-retraction of the landing gear after the engine failure, and the Captain, the pilot not flying, taking over control of the airplane before having clearly identified the problem."
45,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Avro.Avro,"Llandow Airport, Cardiff, Wales",80.0,"During the approach to Runway 28 at Llandow Airport, it appeared to witnesses that the aircraft was going to touch down prematurely. This was followed by an application of power. Climbing to 300 ft. the aircraft stalled and crashed into a field. Due to the placement of luggage in relation to passenger load, the center of gravity was such that there was insufficient elevator control remaining to counteract the rise of the nose upon full application of power."
46,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Aerospatiale.Aerospatiale,"Casablanca, Morocco",61.0,The aircraft crashed 9.7 km short of the runway during approach in the fog and broke in two.

88,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Uberlingen, Germany",71.0,"The airliner and cargo plane collided over southern Germany at 35,400 ft. Debris was spread across a 20 mile radius. Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air trafficontroller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air trafficontroller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air trafficontroller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly, one-and-a-half years later, the controller, Peter Nielsen, was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident."
89,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Near Syktyvar, Russia",54.0,The aircraft crashed in a forest after an in-flight fire caused by baggage that ignited in the rear cargo hold led to loss of contol of the aircraft.
90,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.de Havilland.de Havilland,"Near Arbucias, Gerona, Spain",112.0,"Due to heavy traffic, the flight was diverted from the planned route. The aircraft failed to follow the assigned airway and crashed into a cloud obscured Montseny Mountain while on approach. The deviation from the assigned airway may have been caused by malfunctioning equipment. In addition, the ATC did not realize the aircraft was deviating from its assigned course."
91,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.NAMC.NAMC,"Hokkaido, Japan",68.0,The aircraft crashed into Yokotsu Mountain while on approach. Navigational error after strong winds caused flight to drift.
92,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Over the Persian Gulf, near Bandar Abbas, Iran",290.0,"The civilian Iranian airliner was shot down by the U.S. Navy vessel U.S.S. Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner."
93,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Tupolev.Tupolev,"Near Irkutsk, Russia",145.0,"The plane crashed and exploded in flames in Siberian woodlands near the village of Burdakovka, about 21 miles from Irkutsk. The aircraft crashed during the third turn in a landing approach to Irkutsk, an intermediate stop for refueling. The first officer was flying the plane, when at 2,600 ft., an audible alarm sounded indicating a wide angle of attack. Eleven seconds later the aircraft swung around 180 degrees and entered a flat spin. The captain ordered the engines at full throttle but it was too late and 22 seconds later the plane hit the ground, belly first, broke up and burned.Â Incorrect actions of the crew. Due to poor communication between pilots, they put in the wrong parameters while landing causing the plane to descend at the wrong angle. As a result, the plane stalled and entered a spin and crashed."
94,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Toronto, Canada",109.0,"While attempting to land at Toronto, at approximately 60 feet above the runway, the spoilers were inadvertently deployed causing the aircraft to fall to the runway and lose the No. 4 engine. With the wing on fire, the captain decided to go-around but while circling the plane lost the No. 3 engine and eventually went into a seep dive and crashed. Inadvertent deployment of the spoilers by the first officer while the aircraft was still in the air. Faulty design by allowing the spoiler handle to perform two different unrelated tasks (lift to arm and pull to deploy). After the crash McDonnell Douglas denied there was any design flaw and the FAA decided to issue an Airworthiness Directive requiring a warning placard on all DC8s. After two and possibly three more crashed with the same cause an AD was issued requiring a safety lock be installed."

107,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",261.0,"After taking off, fire was reported in the landing gear well. The aircraft crashed while trying to return to the airport. Loss of hydraulics and electrical systems after a fire, started in the wheel when two tires disintegrated due to under inflation of one tire. This caused a fire which ignited years of accumulated flammables in the DC-8's wheel well leading to an uncontroable fire. The plane was allowed to leave with an under inflated tire. Twenty minutes prior to departure, the Nationair lead mechanimade a request for nitrogen to inflate the low tire. Nitrogen was not readily available and a delay would probably have occur procuring it. The Nationair project manager, without conferring with the flight crew, released the plane."

138,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Convair.Convair,"Skagerrak, Denmark",55.0,The aircraft crashed into the sea after an in-flight breakup. Severe vibration caused by worn bolts causing the rudder to jam and the tail to collapse. Bolts used to attach the fin to the fuselage were found to be counterfeit and wore much faster that genuine bolts.
139,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Aliquippa, Pennsylvania",132.0,"While on approach, the aircraft went into a sudden nose dive from 6,000 ft. and crashed into a wooded ravine 6 miles northwest of Pittsburgh International Airport. The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence."

A number of these birds were ingested in engines No. 1, 2, and 4.  Engine No. 1 was shut down and its propeller was feathered. Engines No. 2 and 4 experienced a substantial momentary loss of power. This abrupt and intermittent loss and recovery of power resulted in the aircraft yawing to the left and decelerating to the stall speed. As speed decayed during the continued yaw and skidding left turn, the stall speed was reached; the left wing dropped, the nose pitched up, and the aircraft rolled left into a spin and fell almost vertically into the water. An altitude of less than 150 feet precluded recovery."
159,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",51.0,"Shortly after taking off from Schiphol Airport, while climbing through 6,500 feet, the No. 3 engine separated with its pylon from the aircraft and damaged the leading edge of the right wing. The No. 3 engine separated in such a way that the No. 4 engine and pylon also separated from the wing. During an attempted return to the airport, the aircraft crashed into a 11 story building in the Bijlmermeer residential district. The design and certification of the B-747 pylon was found to be inadequate to provide the required level of safety. The system to ensure structural integrity by inspection failed. The separation of the No. 3 engine was initiated by fatigue (corrosion) in the inboard midspar fuse pin. This led to loss of the No. 4 engine and pylon and damage to several systems which ultimately led to loss of control of the aircraft."

183,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Charkhidadri, India",349.0,"Midair collision 17 km W of New Delhi.  The Saudi 747 had just taken off from New Delhi airport ascending to 14,000 feet while the Il-76 was descending. Three hundred twelve aboard the B-747 and thirty-seven aboard the Il-76 were killed. The Il-76 descended below its assigned altitude. The death toll was reduced from 351 to 349 after Kazastan Airlines reported 37 aboard rather than 39. Neither aircraft was equipped with an Airborne Collision Avoidance System. The 747 had taken off from Delhi and had been cleared to climb to FL140.  Meanwhile, the IL76, which was inbound to Delhi on the same airway, had been cleared to descend to FL150. However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew's decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight."
184,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Belle Harbor, Queens, New York",265.0,"Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn, at 2,800 ft., parts of the plane, including the vertical stabilizer and rudder, fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistiand exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed."
185,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Antonov.Antonov,"Saratov, Russia",57.0,Crashed short of runway during approach.
186,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Berryville, Virginia",92.0,The plane crashed into high terrain at approximately 270 mph during an approach to Dulles Airport.

234,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Grammatikos, Greece",121.0,"While flying at FL340 towards Athens the crew reported problems with their air conditioning system. As the airliner entered Greek airspace ATC lost contact with the plane. Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn't get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromos, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control was left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing."

The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the center wing tank that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.  To say that numerous government agencies acted strangely and suspiciously would be an understatement.  A great deal of evidence was either suppressed or ignored. Rumors persist that the plane was brought down by a missile, either by the Navy conducting exercises in the area or by terrorists."
277,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Patna, India",60.0,"While attempting to land at Patna, the aircraft was too high and the crew attempted a go-around.

369,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Off Manama, Bahrain",143.0,"The aircraft crashed into the Persian Gulf and exploded in flames while attempting to land at Bahrain International Airport. The crew decided to perform a missed approach after it was determined the aircraft was coming in too high and fast. Instructions were given for a 180 degree turn and climb to 2,500 feet. While performing the missed approach the plane suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 1,000 feet and crashed into the shallow waters of the gulf approximately 1 mile from the airport. The accident was a result of a fatal combination of factors, including the captain's failure to comply with standard operating procedures and the copilot's actions in not drawing the captain's attention to the deviations of the aircraft from the standard flight parameters. The captain may have suffered a 'spatial disorientation' to ground warning systems, which could have made him falsely perceive the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose down input, resulting in the aircraft starting to descend, when aircraft warning systems were saying he should increase altitude."
370,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Mina Jebel Ali, UAE",112.0,Crashed  into the desert after a distress message and during an emergency landing attempt. Detonation of an explosive device in the baggage compartment.

A self-locking nut, other than a castle nut with cotter pin as specified, had been installed at the bolt for connection between the pull rod and bellcranck in the elevator control system. The nut screwed off, resulting in bolt loss, which led to the loss of pitch control."
379,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Vickers.Vickers,"Off Wexford Harbor, Ireland",61.0,"The aircraft was believed to have gone into a spin or spiral dive with recovery at about 12,000 ft. The dive apparently caused structural damage which resulted in the aircraft plunging into St George's Channel, 10 miles east of Carnsore Point.

381,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"JFK Airport, New York, New York",113.0,"The aircraft crashed into the approach lights to runway 22L at JFK while on an ILS approach to the runway. Aircraft's encounter with heavy rain and a very strong thunderstorm that was located astride the ILS localizer course which resulted in a high descent rate into approach light towers.The flightcrew's delayed recognition and correction of the high descent rate and their reliance upon visual cues rather than on flight instrument reference. However, the adverse winds might have been too severe for a successful approach and landing even had they relied upon and responded rapidly to the indications of the flight instruments.Contributing to the accident was the continued use of Runway 22L when it should have become evident to both air trafficontrol personnel and the flightcrew that a severe weather hazard existed along the approach path."
382,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Curtiss.Curtiss,Near Bogota Colombia,53.0,One aircraft from a squadron performing aerobatics before a large crowd crashed into the grandstands. A gust of wind caused the aircraft to lose control during a looping maneuver.

388,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Douglas.Douglas,"Bryce Canyon, Utah",53.0,"Fire was reported on board the aircraft before it crashed.  An almost identical accident with the same cause occurred on 11/11/47. The flight crew transferred fuel either intentionally or inadvertently from the No. 4 alternate tanks to the No. 3 alternate tanks and failed to stop the transfer process in time to avoid overflowing the No. 3 alternate tank. Gasoline flowed through the No. 3 alternate vent line, out the vent, and was carried back by the slip stream, entering the cabin heater combustion air intake scoop. When the cabin heater came on an explosion and fire  occurred. The fire was fueled by magnesium flares strored in the cabin heater compartment. Caused by a design flaw in the aircraft which allowed vented fuel to be carried back into the cabin heater air intake."
389,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Ilyushin.Ilyushin,"Near Bratislava, Czechoslovakia",82.0,"Following takeoff, the aircraft did not follow assigned route and crashed into wooded hillside. Insufficient evaluation of the weather conditions and relief of the terrain by the crew."

393,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Near Puerto Inca, Huanuco, Peru",91.0,"The aircraft was struck by lightning after it entered an area of thunderstorms and heavy turbulence. The lightning caused a fire which led to the separation of the right wing and part of the left wing. The aircraft crashed in mountainous terrain in the jungle. One German passenger, a female teenager, survived and was found after trekking through the jungle for 9 days. Juliane Koepcke had a broken collarbone and was unconscious for an unknown amount of time but had survived the crash still strapped in her seat. When she came to, she set out in vain to find her mother. Maria Koepcke, her mother, a leading Peruvian ornithologist, was dead. Rescue crews searched for the aircraft without success. Koepcke would have to save herself.  Koepcke found a stream and began nine days of wading through knee-high water and fighting off swarms of insects and leeches. On the ninth day, she found a canoe and shelter. Then she waited. Hours later, local lumbermen returned and found her. They tried to get her to eat but she was quite sick and refused. Insects had buried eggs in her skin and they were beginning to hatch. One of the men poured gasoline on her and, as she told the London Daily Mail, 'I counted 35 worms that came out of my arms alone.' The men offered what assistance they could provide but it was too late in the day to start the journey back to civilization; she slept one more night in the jungle before the men took her on the final seven hour journey via canoe down the river to a lumber station where she was airlifted to a hospital."
394,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Cove Neck, New York",73.0,"The aircraft was put in a series of extended holding patterns as it approached New York.The crew informed ATC they were running out of fuel but did not declare an emergency and were cleared to land. After a missed approach and during  a go-around, the plane ran out of fuel and crashed in a wooded area. The captain speaking very little English and communicating through the first officer, at no time declared an emergency. The first officer used the term 'we need priority' several times, rather than declaring an emergency. The ATC did not realize the peril of the aircraft. Failure of the crew to properly communicate the emergency situation to the ATC. Although blame was placed squarely on the crew there are several reasons why ATC should have  taken some responsibility for the accident. ATC was trying to land too many planes at once given the weather and number of missed approaches and aborted landing that were taking place. The plane was put in an extended holding pattern on three different occasions. The crew was not told of wind shear below 500 ft. which led to the aborted landing attempt. The plane was passed between three different controllers as it came out of its holding pattern to land. Each time the crew had to repeat their fuel situation.  The crew did say 'we are running out of fuel' numerous times only to be taken on a wide circling pattern after the first attempt at landing was aborted. Although the major blame was placed on the crew, in the end, the FAA paid 40% of compensations to the passenger's families."
395,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Lake Pontchartrain, New Orleans, Louisiana",58.0,"The aircraft crashed into Lake Pontchartrain, 19 miles northeast of New Orleans International Airport, shortly after taking off. Mechanical failure. Uncommanded extension of the pitch trim compensator. Degradation of aircraft stability characteristics in turbulence, because of abnormal longitudinal trim component positions.  Malfunctioning pitch trim compensator."
396,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Tenerife, Canary Islands",146.0,"The plane crashed into a mountain 5,500 ft. high at 300 mph during an approach to Tenerife. The pilot, while in a holding pattern, took the aircraft in an area of high ground not maintaining the correct altitude. Lack of communication between the pilot and co-pilot."
397,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Chicago O'Hare, Illinois",273.0,"During takeoff just, as the plane lifted from the runway, the left engine and pylon separated from the aircraft damaging the wing and hydraulisystem which caused the aircraft to roll and crash. Highest single plane death toll in U.S. aviation history. Asymmetrical stall and the ensuing roll of the aircraft because of the uncommanded retraction of the left wing outboard leading edge slats and the loss of stall warning and slat disagreement indication systems caused by separation of the engine and pylon. Improper maintenance procedures used by American Airlines when dismounting the engines for maintenance, by removing the pylon and engine together, putting strain on the engine mounts leading to  stress cracks."
398,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Penghu Island, Taiwan",225.0,"The flight crashed into the sea, 31 miles NE of the Penghu (Pescadore) Islands in the Taiwan Strait. The plane disappeared from radar while flying at 35,000 ft. approximately 20 minutes after taking off from Chiang Kai Shek Airport. There was no distress call and the weather was good at the time. Military radar revealed the aircraft  disintegrated in midair, breaking into four pieces. Only 175 of 225 bodies were recovered. The carrier  failed to conduct a preventive anti-rust operation in a timely manner every four years. Damage from a 1980 tailstrike was not properly repaired and fatigue cracks formed, which eventually led to a structural failure."
399,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Near Santa Ana, California",85.0,"Crashed shortly after taking off from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station bound for Okinawa. After attaining an altitude of 1,000 feet, the plane failed to make a left turn and flew into rising terrain. Cause unknown."

401,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Aerospatiale.Aerospatiale,"Gonesse, France",113.0,"The aircraft struggled to gain altitude after taking off from Charles de Gaulle airport. The pilot reported the No. 2 engine failed and struggled to steer towards Le Bourget airfield as smoke and fire trailed the jet's left wing.   The plane was unable to gain altitude, went nose high, stalled and crashed into a small hotel complex.  A metal strip left on the runway by another plane gashed one of the Concorde's tires which blew out sending a piece of rubber into the underside of the wing which sent a shockwave which ruptured a seam in the fuel tank. An electrical severed by another piece of rubber sparked which ignited leaking fuel ignited and started an uncontrollable fire. Power was lost to the No. 1 and No. 2 engines which led to loss of control of the aircraft and subsequent crash. Investigation revealed the metal strip was probably a thrust reverser part from Continental Airlines DC-10-30 , registered N13067 which departed Paris as Flight 055 to Newark. This is the first crash of a Concorde in aviation history."
402,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Fokker.Fokker,"Near Gilgit, Pakistan",54.0,Crashed into Himalaya Mountains en route from Gilgit to Islamabad.
403,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"San Diego, California",144.0,"Midair collision. The PSA was descending and about to land at Lindbergh Field. The Cessna was climbing while engaged in practice approaches. The 727 overtook and struck the Cessna from the rear. The primary cause was the PSA crew lost sight of the Cessna and did not make that fact known to the ATC.  The ATC failed to realize from the PSA transmissions that they lost sight of the Cessna. One hundred thirty-five killed on the PSA, two on the Cessna and seven on the ground. Crew fatigue may have played a part in the accident as there are unofficial reports that the crew attended an all night party and had only 2 hours sleep from the night before."

While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophieffects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti, radio financial talk show host, Dean Forshee, guitarist, Jean Gandesberry, columnist, Tom Stockley, columnist were among those killed."

Poor positioning of the aircraft for an approach by ATC. Questionable information presented by the flight director.
491,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Airbus.Airbus,"Near Kathmandu, Nepal",113.0,"After experiencing difficulty in deploying the flaps while approaching Katmandu, the landing was aborted.  The ATC did not have radar service. After some confusing exchanges between the tower and the aircraft, the crew headed north instead of south to begin its second approach. The aircraft flew into a near vertical mountain wall at 240 knots. In the final seconds, the captain assessed the Ground Proximity Warning System warning as false. The accident was caused by a combination of occurrences, errors and actions by both the crew and ATC. The initial problem with the flaps, the lack of radar service, a misread chart by the crew, communication difficulties and the use of non-standard phraseology among other items led to the accident."
492,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Yakovlev.Yakovlev,"Nanjing, Jiangsu, China",108.0,"The aircraft failed to gain altitude after lift-off, touched down again and overran the runway bursting into flames 2,000 feet past the runway. Possible engine failure."
493,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Lockheed.Lockheed,"Near Wadi Natrun, Egypt",55.0,"While en route from Cairo to Rome, witnesses observed the aircraft on fire. After turning back toward Cairo, it crashed and burned. Failure of the rear master rod bearing in the No. 3 engine that led to an uncontrollable fire. The aircraft was named 'Star of Maryland.'"
494,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Ilyushin.Ilyushin,"Near Magnitogorsk, Russia",101.0,"The aircraft crashed, trailing heavy smoke. Fire caused by spontaneous ignition of passenger baggage."
495,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.MD.MD,"Cerritos, California",82.0,"A midair collision occurred between a DC-9, attempting to land at LAX  and a Piper at 6,560 ft. over Cerritos, California. The Piper struck and knocked the horizontal and vertical stabilizer off the DC-9. The Piper fell into an unoccupied playground.  The DC-9 crashed into a neighborhood destroying eleven homes and damaging seven others. Sixty-four on the DC-9, three on the Cessna and 15 on the ground were killed. The pilot of the Piper inadvertently entered the LAX Terminal Control Area. The inadvertent and unauthorized entry of the PA-28 into the Los Angeles Terminal Control Area. The limitations of the 'see and avoid' concept to ensure traffiseparation under the conditions of the conflict."
496,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Ko Phuket, Thiland",83.0,The aircraft stalled and crashed into the ocean after the crew's attention was diverted to concern over another aircraft. Failure of the crew to monitor their airspeed. The pilot added power and raised the gear after the stick shaker activated but did not execute a recovery before hitting the sea.
497,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",74.0,"While attempting to take off from Jorge Newberry airport, the crew aborted takeoff, overran the runway, skidded across a service road and crashed into several cars and into a golf course, bursting into flames.  The crew had the wrong flap selection for takeoff."
498,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.McDonnell.McDonnell,"Mexico City, Mexico",73.0,"The aircraft struck a vehicle after landing on a closed runway in fog. The tower warned the flight three times about the closed runway. Non-compliance with the meteorological minima for the approach procedure, as cleared.  Failure to comply with the aircraft's operating procedures during the approach phase, and landing on a runway closed to traffic."
499,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.ATR-72-212.ATR-72-212,"Roselawn, Indiana",68.0,"The aircraft was in a holding pattern and was descending to a newly assigned altitude of 8,000 feet when it experienced an uncommanded roll and excursion and crashed during a rapid descent. Icing. The design of the rubber de-icing boot was insufficient to deal with icing on the wings. Sudden and unexpected aileron hinge movement reversal, that occurred after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots while the airplane was in a holding pattern during which it intermittently encountered supercooled cloud and drizzle/rain drops, the size and water content of which exceeded those described in the icing certificication envelope. The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control and the crew was unable to recover. Contributing factor was the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation's inadequate oversight of the ATR42 and ATR 72, and its failure to take the necessary corrective action to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions and failure to provide the FAA with timely airworthiness information developed from previous ATR incidents and accidents in icing conditions."
500,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Fokker.Fokker,"Sao Paolo, Brazil",98.0,The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff into a residential area striking a building. Uncommanded deployment of the thrust reverser on the right engine.
501,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts",217.0,"The plane took off from JFK at 1:19 a.m. bound for Cairo, Egypt. Thirty-three minutes later, after attaining an altitude of 33,000 feet, it was observed on radar in an extremely rapid descent. The aircraft was observed in a 66 degree dive at 483 knots. The descent continued to 16,700 feet after which the aircraft climbed to 24,000 ft.   After that, the plane began a second dive and broke up at around 10,000 ft. crashing into the AtlantiOcean, 60 miles southeast of Nantucket Island.  The aircraft was named Thutmosis III. The accident was caused by the relief first officer's flight control inputs which caused the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the AtlantiOcean. The reason for the first officer's actions were not determined by the NTSB. One could conclude the actions were deliberate in an attempt to commit suicide."
502,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Boeing.Boeing,"Taipei, Taiwan",83.0,"Weather conditions at the time were extremely poor due to typhoon Xiang Sane. A NOTAM issued on Aug 31, 2000 indicated that Runway 05R was closed due to construction between Sep 13 and Nov 22. After reaching the end of Taxiway NP, the plane turned onto Taxiway N1 and then made a 180-degree turn onto Runway 05R and began its takeoff roll. Approximately 3.5 seconds after reaching V1, the aircraft hit construction equipment on the runway, crashed back to the ground, broke up and burst into flames. The pilot attempted to take off from a closed runway. The following factors contributed to the accident. Of three lights used to guide the aircraft onto the correct runway, one was not working and another dim. The airport lacked 'guard lights' used to help pilots navigate from the taxiway to the correct runway during times of poor visibility. International regulations require that a large white X be placed on the tarmaat the entrance to a closed runway, but there was none at the entrance of runway 5R. Whether there should have been, in this case, however, is itself a contentious matter as the runway remained open for taxiing."
503,AirplaneCrash.Manufacturer.Ilyushin.Ilyushin,"Leningrad, Russia",93.0,The plane crashed during takeoff on a flight to Erevan.
