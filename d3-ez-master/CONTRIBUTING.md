## Contributing Guidelines

**d3-ez** is a library of reusable graphs and charts which use [D3](http://www.d3js.org/).

The d3-ez.js and d3-ez.min.js files are built from source files in the src directory.
Do not edit d3-ez.js directly. Instead, edit the source files, and then run 'make' to generate the build files.
